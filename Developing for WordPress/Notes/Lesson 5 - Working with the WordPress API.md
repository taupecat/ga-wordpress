# Working with the WordPress API

There are actually many WordPress APIs. These are some of the more important and/or useful ones:

* Widgets API
* Plugin API (Hooks, Actions, and Filters)
* Shortcode API

But the new hotness is the **JSON REST API**. From http://wp-api.org:

> WordPress is moving towards becoming a fully-fledged application framework, and we need new APIs. This project was born to create an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand and well-tested framework for creating these APIs, plus creating APIs for core.

> This plugin provides an easy to use REST API, available via HTTP. Grab your siteâ€™s data in simple JSON format, including users, posts, taxonomies and more. Retrieving or updating data is as simple as sending a HTTP request.
